Years of independent learning of programming languages led me to study at the University of Zielona Góra, and then to work as a software tester. I took part in small projects written in Java EE / Spring Boot as a backend developer, I write tests based on Selenium Webdriver. I still improve my skills and I am ready for any possibility of expanding my knowledge. I speak fluent English and German. Privately, a motorcycle enthusiast.
